OPEN THE INSIDE SHOULD BE NICE AND SOFT AND REALLY OOZE OUT SO LET'S SEE IF THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN
POSSIBLE TO MAKE THEM SO CHEAPLY WELL TO FIND OUT I'M GOING TO MAKE MY OWN
IT LOOKS GOOD IT COULD TASTE A BIT BETTER
WELL SO IN THEORY I COULD LABEL THIS ON THE INGREDIENTS AS MEAT
WOULD CALL MEAT BUT I SUPPOSE IT'S USING AN INGREDIENT
HEARD OF MECHANICALLY RECOVERED MEAT IT'S THE KIND OF THING YOU SEE ON THE PACKS OF INGREDIENTS OF CHEAP PROCESSED FOOD LIKE
WHEN YOU CUT IT YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CUT WITH STANDARD CUTLERY KNIFE NOT A
WITH A CARCASS THERE'S STILL QUITE A LOT OF MEAT LEFT ON HERE BUT IF YOU MULTIPLY THIS BY MILLIONS OF CHICKENS THAT'S A HUGE AMOUNT OF MEAT SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH IT THROW IT AWAY WELL
TROUBLE IS YOU CAN'T CREATE THAT CRISPY SKIN IN THE OVEN FROM JUST RAW
AND HOPEFULLY CHIP SHAPED POTATOES COME THROUGH
FRESH OUT THE FRYER NOW APART FROM THE GOLDEN COLOUR AND THE DELICIOUS FLAVOUR WHAT REALLY MAKES A CHIP A CHIP IS THE CRUNCH
SO IF YOU HAVE IT IN A RESTAURANT AND IT'S DELICIOUS YOU GO BACK NEXT WEEK YOU WANT IT TO BE THE SAME DON'T YOU THAT'S RIGHT THE
TAKE THE SLICED UP POTATO AND THEY SOAK THEM IN REALLY HOT WATER THEY
REALLY CHIPPY CRUNCHINESS ABOUT THEM DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT'S THAT DONE NOW WHAT COULD BE BETTER TO FIRE MY POTATOES THROUGH THE SLICER THAN A SPUD
GOING TO TAKE UP ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO BE LYING AROUND IN THE
THE FACTORY THEY USE A SLICING MACHINE CALLED A HYDRO CUTTER WHICH INVOLVES FIRING A POTATO DOWN A PIPE THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL A KNIFE BLOCK THAT SLICES THE POTATO INTO CHIP
CAN'T REALLY TELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY OVEN CHIPS AND THE ONES FROM THE SUPERMARKET
A SCHOOL FOR STEAKS SEEN THE PROCESSING BEHIND A CHEAP CHICKEN KIEV AND MADE EXPLOSIVE OVEN CHIPS I HAD NO IDEA PUB GRUB HELD SO MANY SECRETS
THESE DAYS WHEN YOU'RE COOKING CHIPS AT HOME THE TRADITIONAL CHIP PAN OFTEN STAYS ON THE SHELF IN FAVOUR OF A BAKING TRAY AND A BAG OF FROZEN OVEN
OYSTERS YOU DON'T JUST GRAB THEM OUT OF THE SEA AND EAT THEM YOU DO PURIFY THEM BUT THAT'S ALL SO THEY JUST RUN THEM THROUGH UV LIGHT WATER WHICH HAS BEEN TREATED WITH UV LIGHT
THAT UP THE BIGGER IT GETS THE MORE EFFICIENT AND IT WORKS BETTER
ALWAYS GET ONE THAT DECIDES IT'S GOING TO DO SOMETHING HORRIBLE BUT 99 75 ARE GOOD
WHICH IS OPEN BEFORE YOU OPEN IT BECAUSE THAT'S DEAD NEVER EAT A DEAD OYSTER SECONDLY IF THERE'S MUD INSIDE
OYSTERS COME IN DIFFERENT TEXTURES THE ONES WE HAVE IN THE WINTER HAVE A BIGGER MUSCLE
LOOKING AT THESE YOU CAN SEE HOW MUCH THEY GNAW IN ONE GO IT'S ABOUT 5 MM
AND ONE THAT A TEAM OF VOLUNTEERS WORKS LONG HOURS TO MAINTAIN BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE KIND OF TEAM YOU'RE THINKING
AREA UNDER HOPS AT THE END OF THE 19TH CENTURY WAS PROBABLY SOMETHING AROUND 77 000 AND TODAY FIVE SIX
HISTORY HALF THE HOPS EVER PRODUCED HAVE COME FROM HERE AND IT'S BECAUSE OF
SAY THEY SORT OF CRINGE AND THEN THEY JUST EAT THEM WELL LEMON AND FISH ANYWAY YEAH
IF WE CAN DO A DEAL WITH THEM TO GET A COUPLE OF NEW TRAINS THAT WOULD BE
IMPORTANT FIND AND IT MEANS THAT THIS PLASTER WORK IS IN FACT EXTREMELY PRECIOUS THAT WE KEEP THIS
A LITTLE MASS DIAL WHICH IS JUST INSCRIBED INTO THE SURFACE OF THE PLASTER IT'S LIKE A SUNDIAL A VERY EARLY CLOCK
SOME SPARE ONES THERE'S ONE IN A MIRROR IMAGE
THE PLAN WHAT'S THE VISION FOR DREAMLAND THE VISION IS TO TAKE IT BACK TO HOW IT WAS POSSIBLY IN THE 50S OR
UNTIL ABOUT 2007 WHEN THE PARK CLOSED
NUMBER OF FENLAND PLANTS AND INSECTS WHICH REQUIRE RELATIVELY OPEN CONDITIONS WHAT THE BEAVERS DO IS THEY INCREASE THE DIVERSITY OF HABITATS WITHIN THE
AT RISK REGISTER BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SOME QUITE SERIOUS CONSERVATION PROBLEMS I HAVE TO KEEP TALKING TO ENGLISH HERITAGE ABOUT WHAT THE RIGHT THING TO DO IS I'M NOT AN EXPERT OBVIOUSLY I'M JUST THE
IT IN BLACK AND WHITE COMPARED TO WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EXACTLY YEAH AND BECAUSE
THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK HERE IN THE PAST WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT THEY'VE
BEEN LOST OVER THE YEARS WHICH IS REALLY SAD I THINK IT CAN COME
GET TO LOOK AT THEM OUT OF THE WATER FROM THE BACK LEGS
THE CURRENT OCCUPANT IS A VERY OLD FRIEND OF MINE
BUT IT'S BEEN A NATIONAL TRUST GARDEN
FOR AROUND 40 YEARS
AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE NATIONAL TRUST
HAVE A PARTICULAR HOLD ON THE BRITISH PSYCHE THEY COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND OUR LOVE
FOR THE PAST PARTICULARLY AS MANIFESTED BY HOUSES AND GARDENS
OF COURSE
SISSINGHURST
IS THE VERY BEST OF THE NATIONAL TRUST GARDENS
EVERYTHING ELSE AT SISSINGHURST THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO IT THAN FIRST OF ALL MEETS THE
SEE WHAT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS ONE OF THE TRUE WONDERS OF BRITAIN UNDERNEATH A SUBURBAN HOUSE IN MARGATE DO JOIN US AFTER THE COUNTRY TRACKS WEATHER WHEN ALL WILL BE
ANY THAT THERE IS TO BE PLOUGHED INTO THE CONSERVATION WORKS BECAUSE OTHERWISE WE ARE IN DANGER OF DATING IT A WEEK BEFORE IT FALLS
THAT GREAT ARISTOCRATIC COUNTRY HOUSE STRUCTURE WAS ACTUALLY FALLING APART UNDER DEMOCRACY TAX REGIME WHATEVER YOU LIKE AND THIS IN A WAY COMPLETELY INTUITIVELY I THINK MODELS THE END OF A
GARDEN HERE AT SISSINGHURST TAPS DIRECTLY INTO ALMOST EVERY ENGLISH MAN AND WOMAN'S PERCEPTION AND DESIRE FOR THE PERFECT GARDEN
BEAR THINKING ABOUT IF THE PALACE WASN'T THERE IT'S PART OF EVERYBODY'S
WHEN THE MEDICINAL BENEFITS OF DRINKING AND BATHING IN SALT WATER BECAME
IT'S ICONIC AND IT HAS SPAWNED A THOUSAND IMITATIONS NONE OF WHICH ARE AS
HERE UNDERNEATH MARGATE IN A MYSTERIOUS SHELL FILLED GROTTO
ON A GOOD DAY FOUR OR 500
IN THE 50S CAUSED QUITE A LOT OF PROBLEMS IN
THE LODGE HAS A NUMBER OF UNDERWATER ENTRANCES IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY'VE MADE
FINANCIAL THING AS WELL AS BEING THE HOLIDAY
EVERY DAY TO MAKE SURE THE QUALITY IS HOLDING UP SO I FEEL QUITE HAPPY THEN
DECORATIVE ARTS FORM AROUND ABOUT 1900 TAUGHT IN EVENING CLASSES AND ART SCHOOLS AND ALL SORTS OF PEOPLE LAVISHED INCREDIBLE AMOUNTS OF CARE AND
FROM THE HIP MORE LIKE THESE PLEASE WHAT WE WANT IS A BIG PROFIT FROM YOU ON THIS BONUS BUY
WHO PROBABLY CREATED THIS PICTURE AND SHE WAS SO PROUD OF IT SHE HAD HER LABEL
GET IT AT PRECISELY THE RIGHT POSITION TO BE ABLE TO FOLD THOSE INCREDIBLY HEAVY PAGES AND BASICALLY CONTROL THE VOLUME NOW IF YOU DID NOT HAVE LARGE SHEETS OF PAPER BOUND IN A VOLUME TO PUT ON A FOLIO CABINET YOU WOULD HAVE A FOLIO STAND LIKE THIS WHICH WAS MADE FOR INDIVIDUAL SHEETS MAPS AND
DOWN THROUGH SUCCEEDING GENERATIONS OF THE BROWNLOW AND CUST FAMILIES EACH OF WHOM HAVE LEFT THEIR MARK ON THE ORGANISATION AND DECOR
A BIT OF PRESSURE THERE FROM THE BROTHER YES LITTLE PRESSURE TOWARDS THE END YES WELL YOU WERE MISBEHAVING HE IS DETERMINED
TRAVELLED THE GLOBE WITH CAPTAIN COOK AND
THE BIG QUESTION TODAY IS OF COURSE ARE OUR TEAMS GOING TO DRAW BLANK OVER AT THE
SENDING THEM BACK TO THE MAKER SO THAT OTHER DISCOVERIES WOULD BE ADDED AND HE WOULD SIMPLY PASTE ON ANOTHER
WELL DRESSED LIBRARY WOULD BE WITHOUT A PAIR OF THESE JOKERS LIBRARY GLOBES ONE CELESTIAL CONTAINING A MAP OF THE STARS THE OTHER TERRESTRIAL DESCRIBING THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD

THE FIRST FEW YEARS OF GROWING VEGS AND THINGS WAS THE MOST EXCITING FOR
AROUND THE PAN THEN THEY'LL GET EVENLY GOLD
I LOVE ALL OUR TRADITIONAL PIES SHEPHERD'S PIE COTTAGE PIE
DINNER REALLY MACKEREL'S PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST UNDERRATED FISH IN THE SEA BUT YOU'VE GOT TO EAT
AND WE NEED TO LOOK AT FISH SOMETIMES IT MIGHT NOT BE THE PRETTIEST FISH IT MIGHT BE UGLY WITH THE HEAD ON BUT THE TASTE COULD BE FANTASTIC AND WE DON'T KNOW SOMETIMES
SOMETIMES YOU CAN COME UP WITH SOMETHING SO DELICIOUS YOU END UP STICKING WITH
ARE COOKING APPLES AND EATING APPLES I DON'T AGREE WITH IT AT ALL YOU CAN COOK WITH ANY APPLE
AND YET SO DIFFERENT AT THE SAME TIME I KNOW
NOW WE'VE GOT A LOVELY CLEAR NIGHT TONIGHT BUT BEFORE WE ACTUALLY TRY AND FIND COMET HARTLEY 2
SUNLIGHT RIGHT SLAP BANG IN THE MIDDLE OF THE EYE'S RESPONSE WHEN IT'S DARK ADAPTED SO THAT'S WHY IT'S LOOKING
AWESOME OR PRETTY MYSTERIOUS LIKE FOR INSTANCE COMET HOLMES OF A FEW YEARS AGO
NOW WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING HARTLEY 2 OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF
IF ONE COMES WE'LL DEAL WITH IT VERY WELL ON THE SKY AT
PATRICK I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT ASTRONOMY YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING NEXT
BE SLIGHTLY FAINTER TOWARDS THE END OF THE MONTH BECAUSE THEN IT PASSES BETWEEN
AND OBSERVE COMET HARTLEY TONIGHT BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE SKY TO GET AS DARK AS IT CAN POSSIBLY GET SO WE'RE GOING TO SET UP OUR EQUIPMENT NOW
ACTUALLY JUPITER'S BEEN MOVING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS AND GETTING QUITE CLOSE
IN NOVEMBER IT IS VERY CLOSE TO THE START PROCYON IN CANIS MINOR AND IF YOU'RE
PLACES ON THE SUNWARD SIDE BUT IT COULD BE THAT SOME COMETS HAVE JUST
IN TOWARDS THE SUN THE SUN'S HEAT WILL HEAT THE SURFACE AND BECAUSE IT'S MOSTLY COMPOSED OF ICE
THIS WITH A TORCH AND THE SCREEN ON THE TELESCOPE FRONT HERE
WOULD BE VERY UNIFORM AND SO IT SHOULD BE THE SAME THROUGHOUT THEIR
A LONG TIME MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF YEARS THE VERY VERY WEAK GRAVITY WHICH IS ABOUT TWO MILLION
AND WHEN IT'S IN THE NIGHT SIDE OF THE COMET IT WILL SWITCH
THE CONTRAST IN THE IMAGE YOU CAN SEE SOMETHING LIKE 20 INDIVIDUAL SITES ON THE COMET THAT ARE THE SOURCE OF THESE JETS
TIME THE DUST PARTICLES ARE BEING
USED TO SEEING A LARGE TAIL AND THAT BUT ARGUABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF A COMET
WE HAVE HAD PREVIOUS MISSIONS TO COMETS AND THE FIRST PARTICULARLY WAS COMET HALLEY ABSOLUTELY RIGHT PATRICK AND
BUT THERE'S A PARENT THAT WE'RE STILL NOT TOO SURE ABOUT THAT COMES OUT AND IS DESTROYED BY SOLAR ULTRAVIOLET RADIATION AND A PRODUCT OF THAT
LIKE NOW IS A REALLY SPECTACULAR COMET A DAYLIGHT COMET AND I WONDER WHEN WE'RE GOING TO GET ONE WE CAN'T TELL THE WONDERFUL THING THOUGH IS THAT
EVER EVER COOKED WITH ANY RIVER FISH BEFORE AND BASICALLY I WOULD NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE OR CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO PULL A DISH OF THAT CALIBRE TO HIM
IS JUST SITTING ON LITTLE BED OF CELERY
I'LL BE COOKING ZANDER FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR 20 PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT FOOD THAT'S THE WORST PART IT'S NOT THE FACT I CAN'T DO IT IT'S COOKING FOR 20 PEOPLE WHO I KNOW KNOW ABOUT FOOD LIKE
WAS SO RIGHT UNTIL YOU DECIDED TO DO A JAMES ON ME
COOK AND I KNOW ALI IS A WONDERFUL HOST SO THEY JUST NEED TO WORK AS A TEAM
JUST SOMETHING EXCITING TO GET THE PALATE GOING
TO SEE PROGRESS IN ANY YOUNG PERSON TO GROW AND I THINK THEY HAVE DONE THAT THEY REALLY SHOULD BE PROUD OF
I LOVE THE IDEA OF THE RISOTTO BUT THE VENISON FOR ME DOESN'T BRING ANYTHING AT ALL TO THE PARTY
THE PARSNIPS THERE AND I WASN'T EXPECTING THAT
DINNER FOR 20 PEOPLE IN CELEBRATION OF
PRODUCE A LITTLE BIT MODERN CONTEMPORARY WITH YOU KNOW WELL IT'S A CLASSIC
DINNER WHICH SHOWS A HIGH STANDARD OF FOOD AND IT SHOWS AN APPRECIATION OF WHAT THE HENLEY FOOD FESTIVAL IS ALL
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH EXERCISE SO MALVERN WAS A MARVELLOUS PLACE FOR THEM BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENT WAS RIGHT
FROM HER ACTIVITIES AT THE CRIMEAN WAR AND BEFOREHAND BEFORE THE CRIMEAN WAR SHE WAS VERY WELL KNOWN BECAUSE HER FAMILY WERE VERY VERY WEALTHY VERY WELL CONNECTED THEY KNEW EVERYBODY THE PEOPLE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WEREN'T WORTH
FAMOUS IN HER OWN LIFETIME FOR HER INCREDIBLE WORK DURING THE CRIMEAN WAR AND FOR ESTABLISHING NURSING AS A TRUE PROFESSION WHEN SHE VISITED HERE GREAT MALVERN SHE WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR A CURE FOR HERSELF HER NAME OF COURSE WAS FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE
THAT GOD WAS CALLING HER TO WORK BUT SHE WASN'T QUITE SURE WHAT THAT WORK SHOULD BE SHE BEGAN TO DEVELOP AN INTEREST IN NURSING BUT HER PARENTS FELT THIS PROFESSION WAS INAPPROPRIATE FOR A WOMAN OF HER CLASS
AND BEING GIVEN HEAVY METAL POISONS SUCH AS ARSENIC AND
AS MANY AS SHE HAD TAKEN BEFORE THE CRIMEAN WAR BECAUSE HERE HER AILMENTS WERE STRESS RELATED AND SHE NEEDED SEDATION SHE NEEDED SEDATIVE TREATMENTS BY AND LARGE SHE WOULD JUST TAKE THE PACK AND THAT WOULD BRING DOWN HER
CAME BECAUSE SHE WAS ILL BUT DIFFERENT SORTS OF ILLNESSES THE FIRST TIME SHE CAME WAS BEFORE THE CRIMEAN WAR AND SHE PROBABLY HAD WOMEN'S PROBLEMS OR DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS AFTER THE CRIMEAN WAR SHE HAD A VARIETY OF STRESS RELATED
ILL AND HER FAMILY THE WHOLE FAMILY WERE VERY WORRIED LET ME JUST
DAY SHE WAS FAIRLY ILL FOR LOT OF HER LIFE IT COULD BE DOWN TO THE FACT THE CRIMEAN WAR TOOK ITS TOLL ON HER YES DID THE CURE ACTUALLY HELP HER DO YOU THINK
HERE FIRSTLY WE'RE CONCENTRATING ALCOHOL AND BY LAW WE HAVE TO TAKE IT TO 96 ABV THE
DO YOU THINK IT WORKS AND ARE YOU STILL PRESCRIBING IT TODAY I THINK IT WORKS BUT I RECOMMEND IT I DON'T PRESCRIBE IT IT IS VERY GOOD FOR RELAXING YOU
COLD WATER STIMULATES YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM SO IF YOU'VE GOT A COLD I GUARANTEE WE CAN ABORT IT BY EXTRA COLD BATHS I SAY EXTRA OF COURSE RIGHT WELL I AM FEELING A BIT SNIFFLY I HAVE BROUGHT MY SHORTS TO MALVERN SO SHALL WE TRY IT OUT YES
OF SMALL CONVENIENCE WHICH IS PERFECT BECAUSE THIS ACTUALLY USED TO BE AN OLD VICTORIAN
DENNIS FINISH I WOULD BUT THEY DON'T SO I CARRY ON IT'S JUST TAKEN ME IT'S THE SHORT SHOWS
MOVING BACK TO HIS BELOVED MALVERNS THE MALVERNS OF HIS YOUTH PROVED IN FACT TO BE A NEW BEGINNING
WAR DEPRESSED ELGAR DEEPLY AND HIS LAST MAJOR WORK THE CELLO CONCERTO REFLECTED THE DESPAIR THAT HE FELT HE WAS MOURNING A VANISHED ERA
THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME THE DEAD ROOM I'M COMING OUT OF
THIS ISN'T IT I MEAN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S REALLY STRIKING ABOUT THIS APART FROM THE PREVALENCE OF GREEN IS THERE NO COLOURS OR LIGHTS THAT STAND OUT EVERYTHING BLENDS DOESN'T
VERY INTERESTING SO YOU'VE PLAYED EDDIE GRUNDY THAT LOVABLE ROGUE FOR HOW MANY YEARS
THEY'VE JUST FINISHED THAT SCENE AND IT TAKES A LOT MORE THAN I IMAGINED WHICH I SUPPOSE MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU'RE USING YOUR VOICE TO TELL THE ENTIRE STORY WITH ALL ITS LITTLE NUANCES NOW ALL I NEED TO DO IS FIND THE BOSS AND ASK FOR PART
TO MEET TWO OF THE ACTORS WHO PLAY EDDIE GRUNDY AND ELIZABETH PARGETTER SO THEY CAN SHOW ME HOW ALL THE MAGIC HAPPENS
RECALLED THOSE CHILDHOOD DAYS
HE SAID I'M STILL AT HEART THE DREAMY CHILD WHO CAN BE FOUND IN THE REEDS BY THE SEVERN'S SIDE
WITH A PIECE OF PAPER IN MY HAND TRYING TO FIX THE SOUNDS
LONGING FOR SOMETHING VERY GREAT
HAVE MADE OF THESE TREES AND OTHER PLANTS THAT BROKE THE RULES THAT DIDN'T SHED THEIR LEAVES IN AUTUMN THAT STAYED MYSTERIOUSLY AND THEREFORE PROBABLY MAGICALLY GREEN THROUGHOUT THE
THE STRINGS WHICH OF COURSE IS THE ARCHETYPAL WOODY RESIN Y SOUND BUT HE MIXES IN THE COLOURS OF THE WOODWINDS AND AT ONE POINT THE HORNS SO YOU CAN JUST HEAR THEM
I LISTEN TO THE SOUND OF THE TREES AM I WRITING THEIR MUSIC AM I SINGING THEIR MUSIC OR ARE THEY SINGING MINE HE FELT THAT KIND OF WHOLE QUESTION OF THE NATURE ATMOSPHERE WAS WHAT GAVE HIM THE SOUNDS HE
THIS IS WHERE THE COWS ARE MILKED ALL THE CLUSTERS I LOVE THE WAY YOU ASSOCIATE CERTAIN AREAS OF THIS
THE ARCHERS IS THE LONGEST RUNNING RADIO SOAP OPERA IN THE WORLD WITH OVER 15 000 EPISODES RECORDED TO DATE NOW IT'S BROADCAST ON BBC RADIO 4 FROM SUNDAYS TO FRIDAYS AND IS RECORDED HERE AT BBC
THE ARCHERS LOST ITS EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE IN 1972 BUT STILL PRIDES ITSELF IN ITS REFLECTION OF RURAL LIFE I'M GOING TO GO
PLACES YOU'D BE IN REAL LIFE IT'S FUNNY IF YOU WERE WITH ANOTHER ACTOR THEY MIGHT IMMEDIATELY NOT GO TO SAY THIS IS WHERE THE COWS ARE MILKED BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT EXACTLY TO THEM IT MIGHT BE ANOTHER AREA
SOAP BEGAN BROADCASTING NATIONALLY IN JANUARY 1951 AND REVOLVES AROUND A FARMING FAMILY NOW SURELY YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS BY NOW BUT IF YOU STILL HAD ANY DOUBTS HAVE A LISTEN TO THIS THE ARCHERS THEME TUNE PLAYS THAT IS A MAYPOLE DANCE CALLED BARWICK GREEN AND IT IS OF COURSE THE THEME TUNE TO THE
RUNNING RADIO SOAP OPERA IN THE WORLD WINSTON CHURCHILL WAS PRIME MINISTER WHEN IT WAS FIRST BROADCAST I'M IN ONE OF THE VILLAGES THAT HELPED INSPIRE THE SOAP AND IF YOU NEED ANY CLUES AS TO WHAT IT MIGHT BE SEE IF THESE RING ANY
PICK FOR BATTLEFIELD BUT WHEN SECRET PLANS WERE DISCOVERED TO PLACE WORCESTER ON THE FRONTLINES DURING WWII AND TO SACRIFICE IT IN THE EVENT OF A GERMAN INVASION THIS CAUSED QUITE COMMOTION
AND BIRMINGHAM
BEING THE GREAT INDUSTRIAL AREA SINCE VICTORIAN TIMES WITH THE BLACK COUNTRY YOU'VE GOT ALL THE FACTORIES MAKING MUNITIONS AIRCRAFT EVEN CIVILIAN THINGS LIKE GAS MASKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO IT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT THE VERY INDUSTRIAL HEARTLAND
TO THE NORTH OF HERE SO THE IDEA IS YOU KNOCK OUT EVERYTHING DEFEND THE RIVERBANK AND THERE WILL BE NO ATTACK ON
STAIRS TO NOWHERE YES INDEED AGAIN STAIRS STEPS MAKE DIFFERENCE FOR
NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AT ALL NOW I UNDERSTAND IT USED TO BE AN OLD GENTLEMEN'S
NATURE OF ALL THIS INFORMATION WE WEREN'T ALLOWED TO KNOW AND WE HAD AN INKLING OF WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS REALLY WE'VE MANAGED TO GATHER A LOT MORE INFORMATION SO NOW LITTLE
BITS OF INFORMATION ARE FED OUT ALL THE TIME SO IN THE FUTURE WE'LL KNOW EVEN MORE
WITH DOCUMENT EVIDENCE AND SPEAKING TO MEMBERS OF THE HOME GUARD IT ALL COMES TOGETHER TO BUILD A PICTURE OF HOW WORCESTERSHIRE WAS TO BE
HEARTS IS THE GOOD STUFF THAT'S THE ETHANOL THAT'S THE ONLY BIT WE WANT WHAT'S IN HEADS THEN THE HEADS IS THE METHANOL AND THE TAILS IS EVERYTHING
ARE BROKEN DOWN INTO STARCH INTO SUGARS AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO CONVERT THOSE SUGARS INTO ALCOHOL HOW DO YOU DO THAT
TO MAKING THE VODKA YES THE FIRST STAGE IS MASHING THAT'S WHERE WE HAVE TO
THINK THE CURE WORKS YOU'VE DONE A COUPLE OF THE TREATMENTS YOURSELF DID THEY HAVE GOOD BENEFICIAL VALUE I KNOW IT
OF THE REASONS IS BECAUSE IT'S HARD IT DOESN'T GIVE MUCH OF ITS MINERALS TO ANYTHING THAT FALLS UPON
THERE'S ABOUT 5 5 KILOS OF POTATOES IN EVERY BOTTLE YES BECAUSE WE USE THE SMALL ONES LIKE THIS THAT MEANS THERE'S 125 IN EVERY BOTTLE OK WHY USE JUST THE SMALL ONES BECAUSE NOBODY ELSE WANTS THEM THE BIG ONES GET SOLD OFF TO MAKE CRISPS OR CHIPS OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT WE HAVE TO TAKE THE SMALL ONES OUT NOBODY ELSE WANTS TO BUY THEM SO THAT'S WHAT I USE THEY'RE CLEAN SOUND WHOLESOME THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH THEM HOW CLEVER IN ACTUAL FACT THEY'RE SLIGHTLY BETTER FOR THE VODKA BECAUSE THE SMALL ONES TEND TO BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER IN
THE NATURAL MINERAL WATER THAT'S BROUGHT ME TO THE HEREFORDSHIRE SIDE OF THE MALVERNS I'M HERE FOR ANOTHER TYPE OF LOCAL REFRESHMENT THAT'S BEEN WINNING AWARDS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND IT'S MADE FROM THIS THE HUMBLE SPUD
SHE CAME HERE IN MARCH 1857 BUT SHE WASN'T VERY WELL THEN IT WAS AFTER THE CRIMEAN WAR AND SHE CAME WITH HER
SHE WAS A VERY PRIVATE VERY SECRETIVE PERSON
WAS SHE SO SHE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY WHERE SHE WAS GOING UNFORTUNATELY DR GULLY WROTE HER A LITTLE NOTE AND ON THE FRONT WAS
MISS NIGHTINGALE THERE WAS ONLY ONE MISS NIGHTINGALE IN THE WHOLE WORLD THEN SO EVERYBODY FOUND OUT WHERE SHE WAS AND ALL THE NEWSPAPERS SAID MISS FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE IS NOW STAYING AT DR GULLY'S WATER CURE ESTABLISHMENT IN MALVERN THAT'S THE LAST THING SHE WANTED BECAUSE SHE WAS
THE BEST OF THE BBC'S RURAL PROGRAMMES FROM THIS PART OF THE WORLD THIS IS COUNTRY TRACKS
HERE IN 1622 AND AT THE BOTTOM OF JUBILEE HILL IS HOLY WELL AND IT'S BELIEVED TO BE THE OLDEST BOTTLING PLANT IN THE WORLD
KITCHEN WILL SUFFER BECAUSE THERE'S NOT THAT EXTRA BODY TO DO THE EXTRA WORK SO THIS IS REALLY CRUCIAL AND IT'S A BIG SCREW UP
TO FIND THREE TABLECLOTHS SOME SOME
MINUTES UNTIL WE GO INTO SERVICE SO IT'S A TENSE
THE TENSIONS AND HYSTERIA AND TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING UP AND MAKING THE PLACE LOOK GREAT IT'S QUITE A LARGE AMOUNT TO SWALLOW AND I DON'T THINK THEY'VE REALISED HOW MUCH THEY'VE
BUT WHAT I WOULD LIKE IS MAYBE DO SOMETHING BIT MORE DRAMATIC AS
TO MAKE MAKE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE LITTLE CHOCOLATE THING THERE'LL BE A WARM LAYER OF CHOCOLATE
GOOD HERE IN MY ESTABLISHMENT WE WOULD LOOK AT IT AS A PRE DESSERT AS I SAY I MIGHT CHANGE THE CHOCOLATE PERCENTAGE BUT IT'S SOMETHING IN THESE WINTER MONTHS HOT CHOCOLATE WE'D DONE IT IN A MODERN STYLE IT WORKS VERY WELL
GOING TO MAKE SURE I TASTE ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING THAT I DO YOU KNOW I TASTED 90 OF EVERYTHING I DID LAST NIGHT AND THE 10 WHICH I DIDN'T TASTE WAS THE MAIN COURSE WHAT A DONKEY
THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT THAT WAS THE MAJOR MAIN FOCUS OF THE NIGHT AND THAT WAS COMPLETELY SHAMEFUL
WAS STRONGLY ON IT STRONG STRONG STRONG AND IF THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTS
I DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT
HER AS A CATERER
AND MAYBE I WASN'T SORT OF STRONG WILLED ENOUGH TO SAY NO TO HER
BUT I KNOW NOW
THAT THIS IS ABSOLUTE
I'D LIKE A HOT POSSIBLY A HOT CHOCOLATE FONDANT AND ANOTHER THING THAT SHE REALLY REALLY LIKED WAS ALMOST LIKE AN ESPRESSO CHOCOLATE ESPRESSO
HOW MUCH SQUID WILL YOU HAVE ON THE PLATE WELL IT FITS A FIRST PLATE YES IT WILL BE A SORT OF SUBSTANTIAL STARTER
WANT TO SCREW THINGS UP YOU KNOW I CAN IMAGINE BECAUSE SHE'S QUITE BIG AND IN YOUR FACE POSITIVE AND HAPPY IF SHE'S NOT HAPPY WITH YOU YOU'D KNOW ABOUT IT AND I DON'T WANT THAT PRETTY QUICKLY YEAH BE HANGING FROM A
I'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE IT LOOK PRESENTABLE WHATEVER I DO TO IT I JUST DON'T LIKE USING
EVENING OF FOOD AND A PARTY ETC ETC I WANT THEM TO DONATE SO
THAT ANYTHING GOES WRONG I DO NOT TOLERATE PEOPLE MAKING A MESS OF THINGS THEY HAVE TO BE EFFICIENT THEY HAVE TO BE
A MALE HE KNOWS WHO IS REALLY DOMINANT TO HIM SO NOW HE'S MOVING OUT OF THE WAY
AND ACTUALLY THREATEN IT SO MAYBE WALK TOWARDS THE SPEAKER OR EVEN CALL BACK IN RESPONSE AND CALL AT A HIGHER
WHERE YOU CAN SEE A TRULY SPECTACULAR NATURAL EVENT AND I'M HOPING TO GET A FRONT ROW SEAT
GOING TO BE INTERESTING YES WE'RE DOING SOME PLAYBACK EXPERIMENTS SO WHAT THAT INVOLVES IS MAYBE PLAYING 30
CALLED SAMHAIN WHICH IS AN OLD IRISH WORD FOR SUMMER'S END
AND THEN I CHECK ON MY LAPTOP AND I WILL KEEP ON THERE THE REALLY GOOD QUALITY ONES TO BE ABLE TO ANALYSE THEM SO I JUST NEED TO GET QUITE A LOT OF GROANS TO BE SURE THAT I WILL GET GET A GOOD ONE GET SOME GOOD QUALITY ONES THAT I CAN ANALYSE EASILY
OVER HERE BUT THERE'S MORE TO THEIR BELLOWING THAN YOU MIGHT THINK MUCH MORE
BECAUSE LIKE HIM TIME AND TIDE WAITS FOR NO MAN OR BIRD AS THE SPRING TIDE ADVANCES UP THE MUDFLATS SUDDENLY THE WATER COMES RIGHT UP TO THE TOP OF THE KNOTS' LEGS AND THEY TAKE FLIGHT THAT IS WHEN THE SPECTACLE BEGINS
THE FASTEST CARVED PUMPKIN THAT'S RIGHT YEAH A SINGLE
IT IS CALLED A SUMO AND IT WEIGHS SIX STONE THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS LITTLE FELLOW AND GHOST RIDERS AND RACERS JUST GOES ON AND ON BUT WHEN IT COMES TO PUMPKIN CARVING WORLD RECORDS THEY'VE ALL ROUGHLY GOT TO BE THE SAME SIZE AND HAVE A
WORLD RECORDS IN ONE DAY WHAT ABOUT THAT PHENOMENAL YOU LITERALLY ARE THE PUMP KING
OK IT'S JUST PLAYING AROUND WITH THE LIGHT BASICALLY WHAT I DO IS PRODUCE A NEGATIVE OF WHAT YOU WOULD IMAGINE BEING THE FINAL PICTURE OBVIOUSLY IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR US TO SEE THIS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT THAT'S RIGHT
THERE ARE A FEW FARMS AROUND THESE PARTS THAT DO GROW THEM WHICH IS REALLY GOOD NEWS FOR ONE GUY WHO NEEDS A
NOT BECAUSE HE WANTS TO MAKE A PIE OR BLEND THEM INTO A SOUP
FINKLE THE PUMPKIN HAS BEEN PUT ON THIS EARTH FOR ONE REASON AND ONE REASON ONLY TO BE
TEST ISN'T IT THAT IS AND IT'S A BIG RECORD IT'S 50 PUMPKINS CURRENTLY THE RECORD SO DAVID'S GOING TO FIND IT TOUGH HE'S ONLY GOING TO HAVE 1 MINUTE 20 FOR EACH
NOT ENOUGH BY ANY MEANS THE AMERICANS EAT A THOUSAND TIMES MORE THAN WE DO SO THESE WILL
NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED REALLY IT'S STILL A VERY INTENSIVE BUSINESS THERE ARE FAR FEWER ORCHARDS THAN THERE USED TO BE BUT I'VE COME TO ONE HERE IN HEREFORDSHIRE WHICH STILL PROVIDES ENOUGH WORK FOR A
AXIS ONCE A DAY OK BUT IT ALSO GOES
I CAN PUT THE COMBINE BACK IN THE SHED AND THAT'S ONE JOB TICKED OFF THE TROUBLE IS WE'RE ALWAYS
IF YOU'VE GOT ONE BURNING IN YOUR WINDOW TONIGHT ODDS ARE IT CAME FROM HERE THE PUMPKIN CAPITAL OF
ISN'T GETTING THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF THAT SUNSHINE SO THE WEATHER IS COLDER AND DAY LENGTH IS SHORTER THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
THIS YEAR'S HARVEST IS VIRTUALLY OVER THE AUTUMN FOR FARMERS NOW IS ALL ABOUT PREPARING THE LAND AND GETTING THE SEED IN THE GROUND FOR NEXT YEAR'S HARVEST
LEAF IS FALLING BUT IT'S NOT EXACTLY A RIOT OF AUTUMNAL COLOUR
WITNESSING THESE STAGS SHOWING OFF THEIR PHYSICAL PROWESS AS THEY BELLOW AND STRUT AROUND IS A RARE RARE TREAT AND FINGERS CROSSED IF THIS MIST DOES CLEAR
THE SUN'S OUT SO NO INTERRUPTION OF THE PICKING PROCESS
IN EPPING FOREST I'M LOOKING FOR THE FIRST SIGNS THAT AUTUMN'S ON ITS WAY NOTHING MUCH YET
NOT REALLY NO WE HAVE APPLES FOR LUNCH EVERY DAY
PONIES ON THE MOUNTAINS DIED DID THEY MY GRANDFATHER SAID THEY WERE STOOD THERE DEAD FROZEN ON THEIR FEET AW THE ONES THAT DID SURVIVE FROM THAT WINTER WERE REALLY SPECIAL YEAH
ONE OF THE BUSIEST TIMES OF THE YEAR FOR FARMS ALL ACROSS THE LAND AND FOR WILDLIFE IT'S A CHANCE FOR THEM TO STOCK UP BEFORE THE HARD DAYS AHEAD
AND WE HAD THAT FOR SEVEN YEARS AND THEN
SHAKEN UP AS IT WAS BUT THEY HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT WAS COMING NEXT NO THEY DIDN'T THEY KNEW THAT THERE WAS PROBABLY A BATTLE COMING AND THEY
CASUALTIES TO THIS DAY HERE IN NO MAN'S LAND THEY'RE STILL FINDING FRAGMENTS OF THE LOST LIKE THIS BUTTON
THE STALEMATE WAS AT LAST OVER
THE BRITISH COMMANDER GENERAL HAIG TOLD HIS MEN THEY WERE NOW TO WEAR DOWN THE ENEMY'S RESISTANCE
BUT ON THE GERMAN SIDE GENERAL ERICH LUDENDORFF ORDERED THAT EVERY PIECE OF GROUND LOST WAS TO BE RETAKEN BY FEROCIOUS COUNTER OFFENSIVE
IT WAS THAT DETERMINATION
WHICH CREATED THE MUD AND THE SLAUGHTER OF A PLACE WHOSE NAME HAS BECOME SYNONYMOUS WITH THE SACRIFICE OF WORLD WAR
ONE PASSCHENDAELE
OF FEINT AND COUNTER FEINTING GOING ON HERE
AND BASICALLY IT WAS MUCH MORE DEVELOPED THE SYSTEMS WERE DEEPER THEY WERE MORE ORGANISED YET AT THE SAME TIME THE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY FROM THE OTHER SIDE ENABLED THEM TO TAKE CAMOUFLAGE LET ME HAVE A LOOK YOU'VE GOT SOME EXAMPLES OF AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY
BOX OF THESE GLASS PLATES COMES IN AND THEY SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF WARFARE AN AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH OF THE ENEMY IT MUST HAVE BEEN QUITE A MOMENT
PART OF A GERMAN THEY FOUND AFTER THESE EXPLOSIONS WAS FOOT IN A BOOT I THINK THAT WAS TRUE A FOOT IN
AND HORRIFIC THE TRENCHES GAVE A LOT OF PROTECTION IT WAS PARTLY PSYCHOLOGICAL BUT IT WAS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO OUTWIT THE
ZONE ALMOST SMACK BANG IN THE MIDDLE BRITISH FRONT LINES OVER HERE
FOR THE ORDINARY SOLDIER ON THE GROUND THERE WAS A PSYCHOLOGICAL DIMENSION TO THE SAFETY PARTICULARLY IN A DUGOUT
HOW MANY IN ALL ABOUT 145 000 TO 150 000
WAS THEIR LIFE LIKE DURING THAT PERIOD
EM
MY MOTHER WAS ALWAYS ON THE ROADS WITH
DOCUMENTS TO DELIVER
OR ACCOMPANYING PEOPLE TO HIDE THEM OR TO BRING THEM TO A SAFE
MOST OF THE MEN WHO HAD FOUGHT IN THE WAR AND SURVIVED
HAD GONE BACK HOME
TO TRY TO REBUILD CIVILIAN LIVES THEY'D KNOWN BEFORE
BUT THE CONFLICT HAD ALSO CREATED A RESTLESS GENERATION MEN WHO NOW LOOKED TO THE FUTURE FOR ADVENTURE AND CHALLENGES MEN
LIKE THE AIRSHIP PILOT JACQUES TROLLEY DE
YOU HAD THE ALLIED TRENCHES AND THESE WERE MIRRORED ON THE OTHER SIDE BY THE GERMANS
PHOTOGRAPHY WHAT THIS FOOTAGE REPRESENTS IS A MARRIAGE OF THE TWO TO CREATE A VISION OF THE BATTLEFIELD QUITE UNLIKE ANYTHING THAT HAD EVER BEEN SEEN
CAME TO PASSCHENDAELE AFTER THE BATTLE AND SAW THE DESTRUCTION BURST INTO TEARS AND ASKED MY GOD
DID WE REALLY SEND MEN
TO FIGHT IN THIS
WELL THEY DID
AND AGAIN
AND AGAIN
FOR ANOTHER YEAR OF
