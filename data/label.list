AN EYE THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT WE HAD TO A BANDWIDTH OF BRILLIANCE WE WERE BLIND TO TUNE IN AND THE MIRACULOUS CAN NOT HELP BUT FIND YOU AND YOU'D NEVER BELIEVE IT UNTIL IT HITS YOU TIME TO SWAN DIVE IN A TECHNICOLOR INFINITY CLOSE YOUR EYES AND SUBMERGE INTO THE REAL
MAY NOT SEE HIM UN BEAT HIS WIFE BUT YOU STILL GOTTA BELIEVE THAT IT MATTERS BECAUSE IT DOES EVERY SMILE EVERY
TIME THEY SAY
SOME WOULD ARGUE YEAH JUST TWO STEPS BEHIND THE BUCKSHOT
SARCASM STUMBLING FROM THE RIGHTFUL BARREL OF A SKEPTIC'S MOUTH THE HAND OF TRAGEDY STROKING THEIR EGO THEY ASK HOW CAN YOU HAVE FAITH IN THE INVISIBLE
AS IF WE DON'T RELY ON THINGS UNSEEN EVERY DAY SHOW ME THE COLOR OF YOUR WI FI SIGNAL THE RADIO WAVE THAT DANCE SONGS THROUGH YOUR FLESH LEAVING NO EXIT WOUND THE REPULSIVE CHARGE IN YOUR SKIN'S ELECTRONS IS THE REASON WHY YOU'VE NEVER ACTUALLY TOUCHED ANYTHING IN YOUR LIFE SO
BREATH
WAS SUN CHARGED COLORADO OXYGEN JUST 55 DAYS AFTER MINE WAS
HER LAST
A CHOKING EXHALE FACING AT THE ROCKIES
BUT RACHEL'S DIARIES
WILL ONE DAY DWARF THAT HORIZON
PEOPLE ASK ME
NUMBER FOUR
VISUALISATION
THIS MENTALITY CAN BE NEGATIVE OR POSITIVE SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO EXERCISE CAUTION
I DEFINITELY VISUALIZE POINTS
IN WHETHER I SEE MYSELF ACING IT IN OR SERVING IT OUT MATTERS
WHEN I VISUALIZE MY MIND IS MAKING A PREDICTION THAT MY MUSCLES BEGIN TO MAKE HAPPEN
MY COACH REITERATES THIS TO US MORE THAN SHE TELLS US OUR NAMES
BUT THE WHOLE TIME WE'RE THINKING HER METHODS ARE UNORTHODOX
WE'RE FORGETTING THAT SHE'S MAKING US BETTER AND EARNING US POINTS
I DO BELIEVE THAT IN SPORTS YOUR MENTALITY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS YOUR SKILL SET
SO NEXT TIME YOU'RE ON THE COURT
THE FIELD
AND THERE ARE SEVERAL EYES WATCHING YOU AS THE BALL HURDLES TOWARDS YOU
CHOOSE YOUR MENTALITY IT
WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WHEN YOU ADJUST YOUR MIND YOU ADJUST TO SUCCEED
THANK
THIS COULD HAPPEN A LOT WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING AN OPPONENT WHO YOU BELIEVE TO BE BETTER THAN YOU
IN REALITY YOU AREN'T WORSE THAN THEM BUT BY HAVING THAT MENTALITY
YOU MAKE YOURSELF WORSE
NUMBER THREE
DWELLING
THE ACTIVE LINGERING ON EVENTS OF THE PAST
MY TEAM DOES THIS
A LOT
AND WHEN I SAY A LOT I MEAN EVERY SINGLE POINT
BUT AS THE NEXT SET ROLLED AROUND WE FOUND OURSELVES LETTING UP
WE WEREN'T TRYING AS HARD BECAUSE WE DIDN'T THINK WE HAD TO
WELL WE WERE WRONG CAN YOU GUESS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
WE LOST
BAD
OUR COACH SOON INFORMED US THAT WE CHOSE TO BE COCKY OVER CONFIDENT WHICH WE NOW KNOW ARE TWO VERY DIFFERENT THINGS
NUMBER TWO
DOUBTING YOURSELF
IN MY MIND THIS IS THE WORST MENTALITY YOU COULD HAVE
BECAUSE AT LEAST WHEN YOU'RE BEING COCKY YOU HAVE SOME BELIEF IN YOURSELF
BUT NERVES START TO OVERWHELM YOU
YOU OVERTHINK IT
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THE BALL IS OUT OF BOUNCE
IN THE NET
DROPS
IN SPORTS YOUR MENTALITY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT AS YOUR SKILL SET
YOUR BRAIN INFLUENCES ALL YOUR DECISIONS GOOD AND BAD
THIS DOESN'T END IN SPORTS
HERE ARE A FEW SITUATIONS WHERE THIS APPEARS PREVALENT
NUMBER ONE WHEN YOU GET COCKY
DAD I NEED HELP CAN YOU SUPPORT ME TO GO TO AMERICA I PROMISED HIM THAT I WOULD BE THE BEST GIRL I WILL COME BACK ANYTHING THEY WANTED AFTER THAT I WILL DO IT FOR THEM HE SAID WELL BUT I CAN'T DO IT ALONE HE GAVE ME A
YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO IS SO PASSIONATE YOU ARE SOMEBODY WHO WANTS TO SEE A BETTER
FROM MY VILLAGE WHO HAVE BEEN OUT AND THEY HAVE GOTTEN AN EDUCATION WHY CAN'T THEY BUILD A SCHOOL FOR BOYS AND I'LL BUILD A SCHOOL FOR
THEM TO SHOW ME A SIGN OF COMMITMENT AND THEY DID THEY DONATED LAND WHERE WE BUILT THE GIRLS' SCHOOL WE HAVE I WANT YOU TO MEET ONE OF THE GIRLS IN THAT SCHOOL
WHO WANTS TO MAKE OUR TOMORROW BETTER I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU TODAY THAT
ALL CAME TOGETHER THE VILLAGE THE WOMEN THE MEN EVERYBODY CAME TOGETHER TO SUPPORT ME TO COME TO GET AN EDUCATION I ARRIVED IN AMERICA AS YOU CAN IMAGINE WHAT DID I FIND
DAWN IS HAPPENING IN MY SCHOOL A NEW BEGINNING IS HAPPENING
THAT IF YOU DO THAT AND I DO THAT AREN'T WE GOING TO CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN FOR YOUR CHILDREN FOR OUR GRANDCHILDREN AND WE WILL LIVE IN A VERY PEACEFUL WORLD THANK YOU
BE CONFIDENT MOVE OUT BECAUSE AS YOU CHANGE YOUR
I REMEMBER THAT DAY AND I SAW SOMETHING BEYOND WHAT I WAS SEEING IN ANGELINE AND YES SHE WAS OLDER TO BE IN FOURTH GRADE WE GAVE HER THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO THE CLASS FIVE MONTHS LATER
CRY OF THESE GIRLS WAS IN MY FACE I HAD TO DO SOMETHING AS I WENT BACK I STARTED TALKING TO THE MEN TO THE VILLAGE AND MOTHERS AND I
BLAMED FOR THAT AND SHE'S PUNISHED SHE'S BEATEN THEY SAID WE WANTED TO PUT OUR GIRLS IN A SAFE PLACE
THOSE THINGS MADE ME ANGRY I WANTED TO DO SOMETHING AS I WENT BACK EVERY TIME I WENT I FOUND THAT MY NEIGHBORS' GIRLS WERE GETTING MARRIED THEY WERE GETTING MUTILATED
HIM TO CARRY THE REST OF HIS LIFE
SO HE FIGURED OUT WELL HE SAID OKAY
YOU'LL GO TO SCHOOL AFTER THE CEREMONY
I DID
THE CEREMONY HAPPENED IT'S A WHOLE WEEK LONG OF EXCITEMENT
IT'S A CEREMONY PEOPLE ENJOYING IT
AND THE DAY BEFORE THE ACTUAL CEREMONY HAPPENS WE WERE DANCING HAVING EXCITEMENT AND THROUGH ALL THE NIGHT WE DID NOT SLEEP
THE ACTUAL DAY CAME
AND WE WALKED OUT OF THE HOUSE THAT WE WERE DANCING IN YES WE DANCED AND DANCED WE WALKED OUT TO THE COURTYARD AND THERE WERE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WAITING
THEY WERE ALL IN A CIRCLE
AND AS WE DANCED AND DANCED
THROUGH THIS TRADITION
I WAS GOING TO BECOME A WIFE
WELL MY DREAM OF BECOMING A TEACHER WILL NOT COME TO PASS
SO I TALKED I HAD TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO FIGURE THESE THINGS OUT
I TALKED TO MY FATHER I DID SOMETHING THAT MOST GIRLS HAVE NEVER DONE I TOLD MY FATHER
I WILL ONLY GO THROUGH THIS CEREMONY IF YOU LET ME GO BACK TO SCHOOL
THE REASON WHY IF I RAN AWAY MY FATHER WILL HAVE A STIGMA
PEOPLE WILL BE CALLING HIM THE FATHER OF THAT GIRL WHO DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE CEREMONY IT WAS A SHAMEFUL THING
WAS IN A LAND OF PLENTY
I ENJOYED MYSELF
BUT DURING THAT MOMENT WHILE I WAS HERE
I DISCOVERED A LOT OF THINGS
I LEARNED THAT
THAT CEREMONY THAT I WENT THROUGH WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD
IT WAS CALLED FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION
I LEARNED THAT IT WAS AGAINST THE LAW IN KENYA
I LEARNED THAT
I DID NOT HAVE TO TRADE PART OF MY BODY
TO GET AN EDUCATION
I HAD A RIGHT
AND AS WE SPEAK RIGHT NOW THREE MILLION GIRLS IN AFRICA ARE AT RISK OF GOING THROUGH THIS MUTILATION
I LEARNED
SHE LOOKED AT ME AND I SAT DOWN AND I SAT DOWN AND I OPENED MY LEGS AS I OPENED MY LEG ANOTHER WOMAN CAME AND THIS WOMAN WAS CARRYING A KNIFE
AS A POLICEMAN IN THE CITY HE CAME HOME ONCE A YEAR WE DIDN'T SEE HIM FOR SOMETIMES EVEN TWO YEARS AND WHENEVER HE CAME HOME IT WAS A DIFFERENT CASE MY MOTHER WORKED HARD IN THE FARM
ME AND MY SIBLINGS THAT SHE NEVER WANTED US TO LIVE THE
SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF IT AND THIS WOMAN WAS WAITING TO HOLD US
WAS A WOMAN SHE WAS NOT ALLOWED
TO OWN ANY PROPERTY AND BY DEFAULT EVERYTHING IN MY FAMILY ANYWAY BELONGS TO MY FATHER SO HE HAD THE RIGHT
AND IF MY MOTHER EVER QUESTIONED HIM
HE BEAT HER ABUSED HER
AND REALLY
IT WAS DIFFICULT
WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL
KNIFE SHE WALKED TOWARD ME AND SHE HELD THE CLITORIS AND SHE CUT IT OFF
I BLED
AFTER BLEEDING FOR A WHILE I FAINTED THEREAFTER
IT'S SOMETHING THAT SO MANY GIRLS I'M LUCKY I NEVER DIED BUT MANY DIE
IT'S PRACTICED IT'S NO ANESTHESIA
IT'S
MOST OF ALL THE TEACHER WAS JUST WRITING ON THE BOARD
NOT HARD WORK THAT'S WHAT
I THOUGHT COMPARED TO WHAT I WAS DOING IN THE FARM
SO I WANTED TO BECOME A TEACHER
I WORKED HARD IN SCHOOL
BUT WHEN I WAS IN EIGHTH GRADE
IT WAS A DETERMINING FACTOR
IN OUR TRADITION
THERE IS A
THAT I NEEDED TO DO TO BECOME A PERFECT WIFE I WENT TO SCHOOL
THIS GENTLEMAN HE HELPED ME WHILE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL ALSO MY DAD WAS SICK
EVERYTHING I HAD TO DO FROM THAT MOMENT WAS TO PREPARE ME TO BE A PERFECT WOMAN AT
I WAS LUCKY BECAUSE ONE ALSO MY MOM DID SOMETHING THAT MOST
WOMEN DON'T DO
THREE DAYS LATER AFTER EVERYBODY HAS LEFT THE HOME MY MOM WENT AND BROUGHT A NURSE
WE WERE TAKEN CARE OF
THREE WEEKS LATER I WAS HEALED AND I WAS BACK IN HIGH SCHOOL
I WAS SO DETERMINED
TO BE A TEACHER NOW
SO THAT I COULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN MY FAMILY
ARE NOT BEING BEATEN BECAUSE OF THE REVOLUTIONS WE'VE STARTED IN OUR COMMUNITY
I WANT TO CHALLENGE YOU TODAY YOU ARE LISTENING TO ME BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE VERY
I FOUND OUT THAT I WAS ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED AS SOON AS I REACHED PUBERTY MY MOTHER MY GRANDMOTHER MY AUNTIES THEY CONSTANTLY REMINDED ME THAT YOUR HUSBAND
ABOUT CLOTHES I THINK AND SHOES
THEY WERE SNEAKERS AND THIS IS IN A
VILLAGE THAT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE PAVED ROADS IT WAS QUITE
ATTRACTIVE I TOLD HIM WELL
I
WANT TO GO TO WHERE YOU ARE BECAUSE THIS MAN LOOKED VERY HAPPY
AND I ADMIRED THAT
AND HE TOLD ME
WELL
WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU WANT TO GO DON'T YOU HAVE A HUSBAND WAITING FOR YOU
AND I TOLD HIM
DON'T
